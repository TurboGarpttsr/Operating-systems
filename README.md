# Operating-systems
A repository for my Operating systems class
1. The Gaming Room is the client, and they wanted to expand their Android game Draw It or Lose It into a web based, cross-platform version. The game needed to support multiple teams and players, ensure unique names, and run efficiently in a distributed environment.
2. I clearly laid out the recommendations for operating systems, memory, and storage management. The document connects the technical design with real world deployment needs in a practical way.
3. Writing the design doc helped me organize my thoughts before coding. It made it easier to plan for scalability, user sessions, and how different parts of the app would work together.
4. I would add a visual diagram to better explain the system architecture. It would make the design easier to understand at a glance.
5. I turned the client’s needs into clear technical goals, like secure login, real time gameplay, and multi platform support. Understanding users is key to building software that actually works for them.
6. I used structured planning and matched tools to the project’s needs. In the future, I’d include more visuals and feedback earlier in the process to improve clarity and direction.
